My career has been a journey of two distinct yet complementary worlds: the structured, high-stakes environment of corporate banking and the dynamic, fast-paced frontier of technology and Artificial Intelligence. For over 17 years, I built a career in one of Latin America's largest public banks, managing strategic relationships with multinational giants like Embraer and Johnson & Johnson, structuring complex credit operations, and translating business needs into financial solutions. This experience gave me a deep understanding of corporate strategy, risk management, and what it truly takes to drive business results.

But I've always been driven by a desire to build, solve, and innovate. This passion led me to pivot my career and dive headfirst into technology, earning a degree in Data Science and embracing the world of software engineering.

### From Banking to AI Engineering

Today, as a **Software Engineer at Itaú Unibanco**, I'm part of a squad developing a new generation of investment tools powered by Generative AI. Here, I apply my problem-solving skills to build solutions that help people make better financial decisions, leveraging technologies like **Python, LangChain, and advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** architectures.

Before joining Itaú, I led the development of a corporate virtual assistant at **Banco do Brasil**. This project was a masterclass in applying conversational AI to solve real-world problems. We created a multimodal assistant that transformed the internal user experience, handling everything from technical support queries to automated access approvals and dynamic report generation through natural language.

My philosophy is simple: **"If I don't know yet, I'll research, interact, learn, seek help, make it happen, and share."** This mindset is the bridge that connects my past and present, allowing me to translate complex business challenges into robust, effective technical solutions.

This blog is where I share the lessons learned from that journey—from navigating a major career transition to exploring the latest in AI, software development, and the intersection of finance and technology.
